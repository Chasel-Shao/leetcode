## 题目描述
```
A move consists of taking a point (x, y) and transforming it to either (x, x+y) or (x+y, y).

Given a starting point (sx, sy) and a target point (tx, ty), return True if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point (sx, sy) to (tx, ty). Otherwise, return False.

Examples:
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5
Output: True
Explanation:
One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(1, 2) -> (3, 2)
(3, 2) -> (3, 5)

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
Output: False

Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1
Output: True

Note:
sx, sy, tx, ty will all be integers in the range [1, 10^9].
```

## 代码

### Approach #1 

**Basic idea:**
If we start from `sx,sy`, it will be hard to find `tx, ty`.
If we start from `tx,ty`, we can find only one path to go back to `sx, sy`.
I cut down one by one at first and I got TLE. So I came up with remainder.

**First line:**
if 2 target points are still bigger than 2 starting point, we reduce target points.
**Second line:**
check if we reduce target points to (x, y+kx) or (x+ky, y)

**Time complexity**
I will say `O(logN)` where `N = max(tx,ty)`.

```java
class Solution {
  while (sx < tx && sy < ty) {
    if (tx < ty) {
      ty %= tx;
    } else {
      tx %= ty;
    }
  }
  return sx == tx && sy <= ty && (ty - sy) % sx == 0 ||
    		 sy == ty && sx <= tx && (tx - sx) % sy == 0;
}
```
