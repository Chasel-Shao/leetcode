## 528. Random Pick with Weight

https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/

## 题目描述
```
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
```

## 代码

### Approach #1 Prefix Sum

`O(N)`  `O(log(N))`

```java
class Solution {
	List<Integer> psum = new ArrayList<>();
  int tot = 0;
  Random rand = new Random();
  
  public Solution(int[] w) {
		for (int x: w) {
      tot += x;
      psum.add(tot);
    }
  }

  public int pickIndex() {
		int targ = rand.nextInt(tot);
    
    int lo = 0;
    int hi = psum.size() - 1;
    while (lo != hi) {
      int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
      if (targ >= psum.get(mid)) {
        lo = mid + 1;
      } else {
        hi = mid;
      }
    }
    return lo;
  }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(w);
 * int param_1 = obj.pickIndex();
 */
