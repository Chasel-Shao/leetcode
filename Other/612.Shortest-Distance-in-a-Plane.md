## 题目描述
```
SQL Schema
Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
 
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
 
The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
 
Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.
```

## 代码

### Approach #1 

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
  p1.x,
	p1.y,
	p2.x,
	p2.y,
	SQRT((POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2)))
FROM
    point_2d p1
				JOIN
    point_2d p2 ON p1.x != p2.x OR p1.y != p2.y
;
```

### Approach #2

```sql
SELECT
  t1.x,
	t2.y,
	t2.x,
	t2.y,
	SQRT((POW(t1.x - t2.x, 2) + POW(t1.y - t2.y, 2)))
FROM
  point_2d t1
    JOIN
  point_2d t2 ON (t1.x <= t2.x AND t1.y < t2.y)
    OR (t1.x <= t2.x AND t1.y > t2.y)
    OR (t1.x < t2.x AND t1.y = t2.y)
 ;
```
