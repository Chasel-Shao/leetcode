## 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

----
## 题目地址

[https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/)

## 题目描述

```text
There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
There are no repeated connections.
```

### Approach 1: Tarjan

**An edge is a critical connection, if and only if it is not in a cycle.**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> criticalConnections(int n, List<List<Integer>> connections) {
        int time = 0;
        int[] low = new int[n];
        int[] disc = new int[n];
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
				
     		 // 1. build adj
        List<Integer>[] adj = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (List<Integer> node : connections) {
            adj[node.get(0)].add(node.get(1));
            adj[node.get(1)].add(node.get(0));
        }
				
      	// 2. dfs
        dfs(0, -1, time, adj, low, disc, visited, ans);

        return ans;
    }

    private void dfs(int current , int parent, int time,  List<Integer>[] adj, int[] low, int[] disc, boolean[] visited, List<List<Integer>> ans) {
        time++;
        low[current] = time;
        disc[current] = time;
        visited[current] = true;

        for (int neighbor : adj[current]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;

            if (visited[neighbor] == false) {
                dfs(neighbor, current, time, adj, low, disc, visited, ans);
                low[current] = Math.min(low[current], low[neighbor]);

                 // If the lowest vertex reachable from subtree 
                // under neighbor is below current in DFS tree, then current-neighbor is 
                // a bridge 
                if (low[neighbor] > disc[current]) {
                    ans.add(Arrays.asList(current, neighbor));
                }

            } else {
                low[current] = Math.min(low[current], disc[neighbor]);
            }
        }
    }
}
