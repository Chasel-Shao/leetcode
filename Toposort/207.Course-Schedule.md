## 题目描述
```
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 

Constraints:
The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
1 <= numCourses <= 10^5
```

### Approach 1: Backtracking

Time: `O(E+V^2)`
Space: `O(E+V)`

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {

    // course -> list of next courses
    HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> courseDict = new HashMap<>();

    // build the graph first
    for (int[] relation : prerequisites) {
      // relation[0] depends on relation[1]
      if (courseDict.containsKey(relation[1])) {
        courseDict.get(relation[1]).add(relation[0]);
      } else {
        List<Integer> nextCourses = new LinkedList<>();
        nextCourses.add(relation[0]);
        courseDict.put(relation[1], nextCourses);
      }
    }

    boolean[] path = new boolean[numCourses];

    for (int currCourse = 0; currCourse < numCourses; ++currCourse) {
      if (this.isCyclic(currCourse, courseDict, path)) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    return true;
  }


  /*
   * backtracking method to check that no cycle would be formed starting from currCourse
   */
  protected boolean isCyclic(
      Integer currCourse,
      HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> courseDict,
      boolean[] path) {

    if (path[currCourse]) {
      // come across a previously visited node, i.e. detect the cycle
      return true;
    }

    // no following courses, no loop.
    if (!courseDict.containsKey(currCourse))
      return false;

    // before backtracking, mark the node in the path
    path[currCourse] = true;

    // backtracking
    boolean ret = false;
    for (Integer nextCourse : courseDict.get(currCourse)) {
      ret = this.isCyclic(nextCourse, courseDict, path);
      if (ret)
        break;
    }
    // after backtracking, remove the node from the path
    path[currCourse] = false;
    return ret;
  }
}
```

### Approach #2 Postorder DFS

Time: `O(E+V)`
Space: `O(E+V)`

```JAVA
class Solution {
  public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {

    // course -> list of next courses
    HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> courseDict = new HashMap<>();

    // build the graph first
    for (int[] relation : prerequisites) {
      // relation[0] depends on relation[1]
      courseDict.putIfAbsent(relation[1], new LinkedList<>());
      courseDict.get(relation[1]).add(relation[0]);
    }

    boolean[] checked = new boolean[numCourses];
    boolean[] path = new boolean[numCourses];

    for (int currCourse = 0; currCourse < numCourses; ++currCourse) {
      if (this.isCyclic(currCourse, courseDict, checked, path))
        return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  /*
   * postorder DFS check that no cycle would be formed starting from currCourse
   */
  protected boolean isCyclic(
      Integer currCourse, HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> courseDict,
      boolean[] checked, boolean[] path) {

    // bottom cases
    if (checked[currCourse])
      // this node has been checked, no cycle would be formed with this node.
      return false;
    if (path[currCourse])
      // come across a previously visited node, i.e. detect the cycle
      return true;

    // no following courses, no loop.
    if (!courseDict.containsKey(currCourse))
      return false;

    // before backtracking, mark the node in the path
    path[currCourse] = true;

    boolean ret = false;
    // postorder DFS, to visit all its children first.
    for (Integer child : courseDict.get(currCourse)) {
      ret = this.isCyclic(child, courseDict, checked, path);
      if (ret)
        break;
    }

    // after the visits of children, we come back to process the node itself
    // remove the node from the path
    path[currCourse] = false;

    // Now that we've visited the nodes in the downstream,
    // we complete the check of this node.
    checked[currCourse] = true;
    return ret;
  }
}
