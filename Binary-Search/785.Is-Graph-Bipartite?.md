## 题目描述
```
Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.

Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
 
Note:
graph will have length in range [1, 100].
graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].

### Approach #1 Coloring by DFS

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(N + E), where N*N* is the number of nodes in the graph, and E is the number of edges. We explore each node once when we transform it from uncolored to colored, traversing all its edges in the process.
- Space Complexity: O(N), the space used to store the `color`.

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
		int n = graph.length;
    int[] color = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(color, -1);
    
    for (int start = 0; start < n; start++) {
      if (color[start] == -1) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack();
        stack.push(start);
        // color[start] = 0;	// whatever, It doesn't matter whether you add it or not
        
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
          Integer node = stack.pop();
          for (int nei: graph[node]) {
            if (color[nei] == -1) {
              stack.push(nei);
              color[nei] = color[node] ^ 1; // -1 ^ 1 = -2, -2 ^ 1 = -1
            } else if (color[nei] == color[node]) {
              return false;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    return true;
  }
}
```
