## 题目描述
```
Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Follow up:
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

Example 1:
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
 
Example 2:
Input:
["a"]
Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
 
Example 3:
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
 
Note:
All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.
```

### Approach 1: Read and Write Heads

**Intuition**

We will use separate pointers `read` and `write` to mark where we are reading and writing from. Both operations will be done left to right alternately: we will read a contiguous group of characters, then write the compressed version to the array. At the end, the position of the `write` head will be the length of the answer that was written.

```java
class Solution {
  public int compress(char[] chars) {
		int indexAns = 0, index = 0;
    while (index < chars.length) {
      char ch = chars[index];
      int count = 0;
      while (index < chars.length && chars[index] == ch) {
        index++;
        count++;
      }
      chars[indexAns++] = ch;
      if (count != 1) {
        for (char c : Integer.toString(count).toCharArray()) {
          chars[indexAns++] = c;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
